# Thermodynamic Time：Bridging General Relativity and Quantum-Field-Theory

Thermodynamic Time: Embedding Time Irreversibility and Asymmetry into General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory

## Base Space:

In modern theoretical physics, unifying General Relativity (GR) and Quantum Field Theory (QFT) is a major objective pursued by many physicists. However, the differences in their fundamental structures and connection formulations present a major obstacle in this unification process. General Relativity interprets spacetime as a smooth four-dimensional manifold characterized by a dynamical metric and geodesics: the metric itself evolves according to the distribution of matter and energy, with gravity arising from the curvature of geometry. In contrast, Quantum Field Theory treats spacetime as a given, fixed background stage, where particles and interactions are described through quantized excitations of gauge fields. Their basic assumptions about the underlying structure of "space" differ fundamentally — the former requires a variable metric, while the latter demands a stable background. Therefore, whether one can construct a shared base space that simultaneously allows for metric deformations and quantum excitations of gauge fields becomes a crucial threshold that any unified theory must cross.

From the perspective of fiber bundle theory, the base spaces of General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory are different, as are their principal bundles and connection definitions. The decoupling of quantum spin and metric deformation already constitutes the first issue in the construction of the base space and fiber structure.

## Thermodynamic Time:

Neither General Relativity nor the Standard Model of Quantum Field Theory intrinsically embeds the thermodynamic arrow of time or fully acknowledges the irreversibility of time. Although the Second Law of Thermodynamics holds widely at the macroscopic scale, its time asymmetry is not reflected in the fundamental laws of physics. This absence of an "arrow of time" poses fundamental challenges for these theories when describing and calculating phenomena at both the microscopic quantum level and the macroscopic cosmological scale. Therefore, a physically explanatory unified field framework must introduce the Second Law of Thermodynamics at its foundational level — particularly the physical realization of entropy increase and time directionality.

## Two-Layer Fiber Base Space Configuration:

This model introduces a discrete, quantized base space, defining a two-layer fiber structure composed of a quantum dynamic evolution layer — represented by a network of structurally stable, indivisible Planck-scale elementary quantum (SEQ) units made of sub-Planckian components — and a metric layer composed of elastic spatial components directly formed by the sub-Planckian constituents of GR.

In this configuration, sub-Planckian components connect SEQs to form the quantum field network, and since SEQs themselves are also composed of sub-Planckian components, quantum spin in SEQs is defined as rotational conduction emerging from collective excitations of sub-Planckian components. This setup thereby decouples quantum spin from spatial elasticity.

The gauge field interactions of Quantum Field Theory are represented by the SEQ quantum network — through gauge field connections — while the metric deformations of General Relativity are carried by the sub-Planckian components connecting SEQs — through metric field connections. Thus, from a structural perspective, a dynamically evolving, topologically homeomorphic space is established, which unifies General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory.

## Embedding Thermodynamic Time:

Thermodynamic time is embedded into this two-layer fiber base space model that unifies GR and QFT through a time-multiplicative entropy mapping. Time is defined as a quantized elastic network state update scale of this topologically homeomorphic structure. At each state update, multiplicative entropy is calculated based on the energy product of all SEQs. This multiplicative entropy increases as the energy distribution becomes more uniform step by step, thereby constructing a time–entropy mapping. As a result, this two-layer fiber base space model acquires an irreversible arrow of time.

## Mirror relationship between metric variation and quantum field oscillation frequency

Additionally, the model establishes a mirror relationship between metric variation and quantum field oscillation frequency (consistent with phenomena such as gravitational redshift and general relativistic time dilation), thereby not only providing a concrete mechanism for gravitational time dilation in General Relativity, but also making the connection between General Relativity and Quantum Field Theory more explicit.

In this way, we obtain a preliminary framework of a quantized elastic spacetime model that unifies Quantum Field Theory and General Relativity, with thermodynamic time embedded within it.
